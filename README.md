# What is this repo?
I'll be using this repo to version control some mods I'm writing for
Stardew Valley, an excellent game that I encourage anyone to check out.
I don't intend to publish these in any formal capacity, I'm doing this
for fun and I don't want to support any code long-term.

# But why?
Because learning a new programming language is fun and Stardew Valley
is fun. I've nearly 100%ed the game and am looking to do a modded
second playthrough with my personal tweaks. Some of these might be
redundant with mods that are already out there, but that's okay
because making them myself is half the fun.

# What kinds of mods are you writing?
Largely tweaks to game mechanics for things that I find tedious and to
increase the feeling of "late game" scaling. I want my second playthrough
to be chill and relaxing without being immediately easy, but I don't want
to plod along at low speeds or worry about micromanaging things.

Alternatively: I don't know, we'll see.
